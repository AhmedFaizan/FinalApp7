  <h3>When did CF start?</h3>
  <p>Cf could have started at about 3000BC(when the stone henge was being built)</p>
  <p>Dr.Dorothy Hansine first described CF in 1938</p>
  <p>In 1989, Dr.Lap-Chee Tsui and his team discovered the gene that causes CF</p>

  <h3>How have conditions improved?</h3>
    <p>Life expectancy of CF patients have increased rapidly in the past 40 years.</p>
    <p>Life expectancy of a kid with CF was just 18 years 10 years ago. Now it is 35 years </p>
    <p>90% of all kids who have CF survive the first year.</p>
  <h3>Why is CF so difficult to cure</h3>
    <p>There are over 1800 Cf mutations. Which means the infection changes in many ways. This makes it very difficult to cure all forms of cystic fibrosis.</p>
    <p>Pinpointing the gene that causes was dicovered recently and many research reamins to be done</p>
    <p>Differenct medicines work for different people</p>
    <p>Differnt foods work for different people</p>
    <p>Problems faced by CF patients are very different</p>

  <h3>What may happen in future?</h3>
    <p>Reasesrch could find better medicines for dealing with CF</p>
    <p>Reasearch could stop CF from mutating(changing any further)</p>
    <p>Research could find a cure for CF completely</p>

  <h3>Who is affected by CF?</h3>
    <p>Caucasian(white european) people get Cf more than others </p>
    <p>There are 30000 people in U.S.A that has cystic fibrosis, about 1000 kids get CF every year</p>
    <p> One in every 15000 african american kids born, have cystic fibrosis</p>
    <p>Most cystic fibrosis kids are diagnosed when they are 3 years old</p>
    <p>Cf is a heredetary disease. Children of CF patients or carriers get CF</p>

  <h3>Who is reaserching about CF?</h3>
    <p>A lot of research is being done to find a cure for cystic fibrosis and god willing, we will find a cure very soon.</p>
    <p>Many researchers and scientists are busily working to find a cure.</p>
    <p>Research is done in research centers, where many people contribute to the research.</p>
    <p>Foundations like the Cystic fibrosis foundation is the world leader in this research.</p>
    <img class="ImageBetweenText img-rounded" src="img/statspageimage7.jpg">
    <h3>Where has it spread the most?</h3>
    <p>The USA is one of the countries where many people have cystic fibrosis. One in every four kids born has the chance of getting cystic fibrosis.  </p>
    <p></p>
  <h3>How can you help?</h3>
    <p>You can help by sharing your progress with researchers</p>
    <p>You can participate in charity events held to fund CF research</p>
