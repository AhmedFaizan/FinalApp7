<h3>What problems CF kids face?</h3>
  <p> Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that makes the body produce a thick, sticky mucus. This will cause trouble in two main areas that are digestive system and teh lungs of kids who have CF</p>
  <p> In addition to problems in the airways and lungs, mucus-producing cells line the digestive tract, including the stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and reproductive organs. </p>
  <p>The pancreas produces enzymes that help digest food and hormones that help absorb sugar. When thick mucus in the pancreas clogs up the narrow passageways, it can make it difficult for kids to digest food and get all the vitamins and nutrients they need.</p>
